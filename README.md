Mini Property Listing App

This is a small full-stack project I built using the MERN stack.
It’s basically a mini property dashboard where you can:

See all the properties (shown as cards)

Filter by type (House / Apartment / Villa)

Search by name or location

Add a new property

View more details about a property

I’ve kept it simple, mainly to practice connecting React with a Node/Express backend and MongoDB.


Example POST body:

{
  "name": "3 BHK Apartment",
  "type": "Apartment",
  "price": 850000,
  "location": "Faridabad",
  "description": "A modern apartment with a beautiful view",
  "image": "https://via.placeholder.com/400x200"
}

Screenshots

I added a /screenshots folder in the frontend repo where you can see how the app looks.
